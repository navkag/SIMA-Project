## Higher Dimensional Quantile Regression Analysis

The SIMA-Project focuses on conducting higher dimensional quantile regression analysis using random forest regressor as the model.

### Project Overview

In this project, we explore two types of quantile regression:

1. **Single-output Quantile Regression**: Analyzing the relationship between predictors and a single target variable.
2. **Multiple-output Quantile Regression**: Investigating the relationship between predictors and multiple target variables simultaneously.

### Dataset Analysis

We analyze two types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated on demand according to a predefined function, such as y = sqrt(x).
2. **Real-life Datasets**: Obtained from sources like Kaggle, offering diverse and real-world data for analysis.

### Project Workflow

1. **Synthetic Data Analysis**: Initially, we conduct quantile regression on synthetic data to understand the method's application and behavior.
2. **Real-life Dataset Analysis**: Subsequently, we apply quantile regression techniques to real-life datasets sourced from the web, providing insights into practical applications.

### Conclusion

The SIMA-Project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of higher dimensional quantile regression and its application across synthetic and real-life datasets. Through this analysis, we gain insights into modeling complex relationships and making robust predictions in various domains.
