# SIMA-Project
Higher Dimensional Quantile Regression Analysis.

The model used to carry out quantile regression is random-forest regressor.

In this project we have carried out analysis on two types of quantile regression: 
1) Single-output
2) Muliple-output

We have also considered two types of datasets: 
1) Synthetic (one in which data is generated on demand defined by a function).
2) Real-life datasets from kaggle.
