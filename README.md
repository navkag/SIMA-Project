# SIMA-Project

## Higher Dimensional Quantile Regression Analysis.

The SIMA-Project focuses on conducting higher dimensional quantile regression analysis using random forest regressor as the model.

### Note

Please note that the figures may not be visible directly on GitHub. It is recommended to download the zipped repository and open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Ensure to place the necessary CSV files in the same directory for seamless execution.


### Project Overview

In this project, we explore two types of quantile regression:

1. **Single-output Quantile Regression**: Analyzing the relationship between predictors and a single target variable.
2. **Multiple-output Quantile Regression**: Investigating the relationship between predictors and multiple target variables simultaneously.

### Dataset Analysis

We analyze two types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated on demand according to a predefined function, such as y = sqrt(x).
2. **Real-life Datasets**: Obtained from sources like Kaggle, offering diverse and real-world data for analysis.

### Project Workflow

1. **Synthetic Data Analysis**: Initially, we conduct quantile regression on synthetic data to understand the method's application and behavior.
2. **Real-life Dataset Analysis**: Subsequently, we apply quantile regression techniques to real-life datasets sourced from the web, providing insights into practical applications.

### Usage
1. **Downloading**: Download main_project.ipynb and all .csv files and store them in the same directory.
2. **Initializing**: Open Google Colab and upload the downloaded files. Connect to a runtime of your preference. *or* Open terminal with current directory containing downloaded files. Run 'jupyter notebook' command on terminal. A kernel will open on your default browser and open the .ipynb file.
3. **Running**: To run each code cell, select the cell you want to run and use the keys: 'select + return' on Mac *or* 'select + enter' on PC.

### Conclusion

The SIMA-Project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of higher dimensional quantile regression and its application across synthetic and real-life datasets. Through this analysis, we gain insights into modeling complex relationships and making robust predictions in various domains.
