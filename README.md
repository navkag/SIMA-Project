# SIMA-Project
Higher Dimensional Quantile Regression Analysis.

The model used to carry out quantile regression is random-forest regressor.

In this project we have carried out analysis on two types of quantile regression: single-output and muliple-output regression. We have also considered two types of datasets: synthetic (one which is generated on demand) and real-life datasets from kaggle.
